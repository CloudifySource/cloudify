  IMPORTANT NOTE:
   This package has been copied as-is from the apache commons-vfs project. At the time this
   note was added, the SMB provider is still in the sandbox of the vfs project. It has 
   been there for a long while, and it is not clear if anyone is maintaining it.
   Nevertheless, the provider works, so it is copied here.
   Note that there IS a vfs sandbox project in the apache snapshots maven repository,
   but the jar file available there is not compatible with the vfs project's jar file. 
   Specifically, the smb provider available in the repo uses the vfs package name, whereas
   the current vfs implementation uses vfs2.
   The sandbox projects relies on jcifs 0.8.3, which is outdated. Cloudify uses a more
   up-to-date version. This required a minor change in the SmbFileObject class, but other then
   that, and disabling checkstyle for all files in the package, the smb provider classes remain as is.
