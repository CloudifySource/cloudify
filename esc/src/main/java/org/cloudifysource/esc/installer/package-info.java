/**********************************
 * The agentless installer is responsible for installing cloudify on a remote machine using a remote
 * login mechanism (i.e. ssh) and starting the cloudify agent.
 * The main class is AgentlessInstaller.
 * 
 * 
 * Agentless Installation:
 * The agentless installation process is a two-phase process:
 * 1. File copy: files are copied from a local folder (directory on the machine running the AgentlessInstaller) to a remote directory on
 * the remote host. The following file transfer protocols are supported:
 * 		- SCP: Used with *nix systems. Uses port 22 by default. Files are encrypted over the wire. Supported authentication mechanisms are username/password and
 * 		PEM certficate files (files can't be secured with a password)
 * 		- CIFS: Used with windows systems. Files are copied in the clear. Defaults to port 445. Supports username/password authentication.
 * 
 * 	The local directory is expected to hold at-least one file - the script that will be executed in the second phase. Applications may add additional files to this
 * directory, as well as sub-directories, which will be copied recursively. These files will be copied to the new machine and can be made available to code running on them.
 * 
 * Note that the installation process often runs on remote machines and over limited bandwidth, so it is not recommended to transfer large files using this mechanism.
 * 
 * 2. Remote execution: A bootstrap script is executed on the remote machine. This script is responsible for setting up Java, Cloudify, running the cloudify agent and starting
 * up any management services, if required. The following remote execution protocols are supported:
 * 
 *  	- SSH: Used with *nix systems. Uses port 22 by default. Commands are encrypted over the wire. Supported authentication mechanisms are username/password and
 * 		PEM certficate files (files can't be secured with a password).
 * 	
 * 		- WinRM: Used with Windows systems. Uses port 5985 by default. Commands are encrypted over the wire (configured on the server). See more details below.
 * 
 * When the second phase is finished, the remote node should be connected to the cloudify cluster.
 * 
 * Windows Support:
 * ----------------
 * Cloudify uses MS Powershell to remote execute commands on remote windows machines. This means that running the installation process for a target windows machine
 * requires that the client running the installation process also run windows. This means that a windows machine can start a linux machine,
 * but only a windows machine can start another windows machine.
 *  
 * Bootstrapping nodes running Windows requires some additional setup. 
 * First, the client machine (which will run the bootstrap-cloud command) must be configured correctly for using winrm. Open a powershell window 'as administrator'
 * and execute the following two commands:
 * 
 * set-item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value * -Force
 * set-item WSMan:\localhost\Shell\MaxMemoryPerShellMB -Value 0 -Force
 *
 * If running on a 64-bit machine, it is a good idea to open an x86 powershell window and execute the above commands as well.
 * 
 * You only need to do this once.
 * 
 * Important: Setting the TrustedHosts setting to '*' has some security implications. You may want to consult with your system administrator about this setting.
