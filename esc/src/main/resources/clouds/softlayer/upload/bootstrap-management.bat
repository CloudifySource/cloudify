rem Bootstrapping launcher for Windows based cloudify agent.
rem This file launches a power shell script that is responsible for downloading and setting up cloudify,
rem as well as creating the agent startup script which will be invoked asynchronously via the task scheduler.

rem Setting the execution policy has to happen outside the powershell script.
echo Setting execution policy
rem output of this command is piped to null to prevent error messages generated by loading a profile for killing 
rem the remote powershell session. Powershell considers any writes to syserr as an error indication.
